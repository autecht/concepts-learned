<h1>C</h1>
C is a low level programming language. Its low level syntax makes it efficient, and
many other programming are built off of it. It is statically typed and uses pass by reference.
There are no out-of-bounds compiler errors, strings are arrays of characters (though string literals
are immutable), and pointers are used. Structs can be used to immitate objects.
