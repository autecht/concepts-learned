<h1>C++</h1>
<p>C++ is a programming language built off of C with many useful features. It is designed to streamline creating functional 
code, not to catch nonfunctional code. It is statically-typed and pass-by-value, with whole copies of objects
 (rather than just copies of references) being passed into functions. As in C, there are pointers which allow pass-by-reference.
  In addition, the & operator is overloaded so that variables created with it point to the same memory address 
  as the variable it is assigned to. Useful features in C++ include vectors, the ability to overload operators and 
  the use of namespaces. Classes in C++ have a public and private field instead of each variable having private and public access modifiers individually.
   Dynamic memory allocation is handled with the new and delete keywords.</p>

<h2>Useful Functions</h2>
<code><pre>
    stoi(string s) coverts string to int
    someVector.front() and someVector.back() return front and back elements of someVector, respectively
    someVector.size() returns size of vector
    someVector.capacity() returns capacity allocated for vector (size of backing array)
    someVector.push_back() adds element to end of someVector
    someVector.pop_back() removes element from end of someVector
    someVector.insert(iterator, elem) inserts elem before element pointed to by iterator
    someVector.erase(iterator) erases element pointed to by iterator
