<h1>Python</h1>
<p>Python is a high level and widely used programming language with extensive libraries.
It excels both as an easy language for beginnner programmers to learn and an invaluable tool 
in machine learning, data science, and much more. It is dynamically-typed, is object-oriented,
 and uses pass-by-reference for mutable objects. Python uses indentation to define blocks.
 The first parameter of non-static methods is the object itself.</p>
 <h2>Example Syntax</h2>
 <pre>
 <code>
from random import randrange

class RandomList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nums = []
        for i in range(100):
            self.nums.append(randrange(100))
            
    @staticmethod
    def printNums(nums):
        """
            print numbers in array with random number based on user input
            nums: list
            rtype: void

        """
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            print("Would you like to print current number (type yes or no)?")
            response = input()
            if (response == "yes"):
                print(nums[i])
            elif (response != "no"):
                print("Assuming you put no")
            
            

def main():
    rand = RandomList()
    RandomList.printNums(rand.nums)
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
 </code>

<h2>Useful Functions</h2>
<code><pre>
string.split(delimeter) returns list of substrings that were separated by delimeter
range(inclusiveStart, exclusiveEnd, increment) returns iterable that begins at inclusiveStart and increments by increment until hitting exclusiveEnd
round(float, decimalPlaces) rounds the float to decimalPlaces digits after the decimal point
max(iterable) returns maximum value
string.upper() converts characters to uppercase
string.lower converts characters to lowercase
delimeter.join(list) concatenates strings in list with delimeter in between
string.replace(char1, char2) replaces instances of char1 with char2
